            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              Space Keys is a captivating game that challenges your rhythm and reflexes. 
              Your mission is to catch as many celestial music objects as possible, 
              by navigating two UFOs through space using webcam-based hand tracking technology. 
              Scores ranging from "Stellar!" for perfect catches to "Lost in space" for 
              the occasional miss add a dynamic layer to your interstellar journey. 
              Each successful catch not only contributes to your score but also 
              enhances the song, creating a harmonious symphony that evolves with your skill. 
              Are you ready to listen to some great music on your journey through space?

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
              For this project we wanted to do something that was just for fun and 
              could be taken in any creative direction that we wished for it to go, 
              and which didn’t speak to any bigger cause or was meant to inform people. 
              Another requirement we had was to not be limited by access to hardware, 
              as our previous project had provided some limitations in that regard. 
              Finally, we wanted to work with game logic and include sound from the 
              very beginning, instead of it being an addition towards the end.

            <h3>Technology Used</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p>
                Unity is a real-time development engine made for facilitating collaboration
                and building games and other interactive experiences. It was used to host the game 
                world, because we had previous experience with Unity within the team.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                Blender is a free and open source software commonly used for 3D modeling and animation.
                We used Blender to create our own 3D models which we could import into Unity, and 
                we opted to use this tool because we had experience with this within the team too.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                FMOD was used to add music to our game, because it is easily integrated with Unity.
              </p></li>
              <li><p>
                Mediapipe for Unity is an existing solution which enables, among other things, hand 
                tracking using webcam. On top of this solution we also built our own algorithms to decide
                the position of the center of a tracked hand, as well as to detect when the user makes
                fists with their hands.
              </p></li>

            <h3>Challenges and Obstacles</h3>
            <p>As with any project, we of course faced difficulties along the way with Space Keys. 
              Initially, we intended to have people interact with the game using a smartphone, and 
              we thought this could be accomplished by using data from the built-in accelerometer 
              sensor. We tried this approach, but had to let go of that idea as we couldn’t find a 
              suitable way to accomplish the interaction we wanted using this method. It was 
              challenging to spend a lot of time and effort on researching how to firstly connect 
              the smartphone to a laptop using a client-server architecture, and then how to use 
              the accelerometer data in a reasonable way, only to have to scrap the entire idea in 
              the end. 
              It has also sometimes been challenging to coordinate the work on this project, as our 
              group was comprised of 6 people, who all had very busy schedules. 
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
            <p>One thing we learned from this project is that it can be a good idea to limit the amount 
              of time spent on researching something, so that there is still time for whatever else needs 
              to be done. Additionally, it is good to try to plan when to meet ahead of time, or set a 
              recurring time each week for example. Because although we continuously used Discord to keep 
              each other updated on progress made or issues we faced, we would sometimes need to have a 
              more thorough discussion to be able to make decisions. And that can be incredibly hard to 
              find time for, when you are this many people, who are all very busy with other things as 
              well. </p>

                <h5>User Interface</h5>
                <p>The user interface was inspired by traditional arcade machines and games. 
                  Since the overarching theme of the game was neon and retro, much like old 
                  arcades, we followed the same for the GUI of the game. The UI was meant to
                  blend in with the rest of the game using similar color schemes and placed 
                  in locations that would not interfere with the player’s experience of 
                  playing the game. Its main purpose was to provide instructions, remind 
                  players of possible actions, show progress, and give feedback. 
                  There were two elements that received special attention:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h5>Text</h5>
                      <p>Each text element was mostly white with 2 undertones of other 
                        colors - one darker and one lighter to give it a 3D feel. The 
                        font chosen was bold and in capitals. This choice was based on 
                        the fact that a lot was happening on the screen at all times in 
                        terms of light as well as movement. Hence, the text needed to be 
                        clearly visible without a lot of effort.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>Icons</h5>
                      <p>The icons were instrumental in communicating instructions clearly. 
                        Since our interactions were mostly based on hand gestures, we used 
                        bold white line icons of hand positions and gestures with text to 
                        support the same.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>General Art Direction</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>Making Mood Boards and collecting resources to anchor our graphic elements</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Making sketches of possible stage arrangements</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Making the first mock-up of the decoration around the stage</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Working on developing Emissive materials and exploring their use within the 
                        game for beautification and graphic enhancement</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>3D Modeling of Elements</h5>
                  <p>The prism shaped game objects were initially developed as a part of the stage 
                    decoration. However, they were later adapted to work as interactive gameplay 
                    objects used to trigger the melody.
                    I also create a 3D model of an asteroid field. In the process, I used Blender modeling. 
                    I learned UV wrapping and unwrapping, animating objects in Blender and Unity.
                    I attempted to write a script in Unity to animate the asteroids with the help of a friend.
                    A functional black hole. Used a free Unity shader online and modified it to our needs.
                    Learned how to use particle systems and restrict them within a sphere for the star clusters. 
                    Learned to write a bit of code to spawn and control particles and their brightness, size, etc.</p>
                    <h5>Evaluation and Documentation</h5>
                    <p>I also conducted evaluation during testing, and edited the making-of video.</p>

                <h5>Audio-Visual Mapping</h5>
                <p>Since the audio is a central part of this game, it needed to be properly and intuitively 
                  integrated into the experience. The melody pitch and brightness were spatially mapped to 
                  the horizontal and vertical positions of the melody objects (stars). The colors of music 
                  objects also had an intuitive mapping based on audio-color mapping research. The choice 
                  of which space objects to use for which music object was also made with logical reasoning 
                  behind it: hard objects (asteroids) for drums, single stars for melody and multiple stars 
                  for harmony, a black hole for the low-pass filter (absorbing the song’s top frequencies), 
                  etc.</p>
                  <h5>Audio Composition</h5>
                  <p>We created our own music and background audio. It comprises 18 audio files created in 
                    Logic Pro and four audio effects applied in Unity. The song was designed in Logic Pro, 
                    and exported in shorter samples that were then looped and triggered in Unity at the right 
                    positions in time.</p>
                  <h5>Audio Programming</h5>
                  <p>For the audio programming, the Unity audio system FMOD was used. The audio can be divided 
                    into background audio and game audio. The background audio is triggered regardless of the 
                    user's actions – spaceship sound, drums, bass, and some harmony. Game audio is triggered 
                    as the user collides with specific music objects. The generation of music objects was 
                    programmed as a low-level version of a MIDI editor, with a function triggering a specific 
                    music object at a specific time and (x, y) position. The game audio consists of melody, 
                    harmony, “space probe” audio, and sound effects (reverb, low-pass filter, high-pass filter, 
                    and flanger).</p>

                <h5>User Interface</h5>
                <p>Established the functional framework of the user interface and was responsible 
                for collaborating with the UI designer to bring the design elements into that framework.
                Completed the development of the game user interface, including the Home Scene, Main Game 
                Scene, and End Scene.The user interface also has implemented multi-resolution adaptation 
                on different devices.</p>
                <h5>Game Logic</h5>
                <p>Designed the game's scoring rules and created the animations for the game score and score 
                  changes. I also wrote a GameManager to control the main logic of the game. This includes the 
                  game's pause, resume, scene transitions, etc. MediaPipe's Unity plugin does not have a hand 
                  gesture tracking solution. Therefore, I developed a gesture detection feature based on the 
                  hand-tracking solution for detecting fists.</p>
                <h5>Game Testing</h5>
                <p>After the scene merging, I was responsible for testing and debugging the main scene, and fixing 
                  problems caused by the code and scene merging.</p>
